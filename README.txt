NoteBooks are expected to run in the following order:
    data/preprocess.ipynb
    model/intergrated.ipynb, net_zero/generate.ipynb
    model/implications.ipynb


CO2_{i}
implications of other variables under CO2_{i} (without ground truth)

Intro to 3 types of net zeros, with plots of CO2_1, CO2_2, CO2_3

Describe the pair-wise correlation between variables. Give models.

Use models to predict the implications of CO2_1, CO2_2, CO2_3.
